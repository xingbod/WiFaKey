# Generating Cryptographic Keys from Faces in the Wild (IEEE TIM)

Run `Neural_MS_BSC_test.py` for the key generation experiment.

Run `Neural_SP_BSC_test.py` for comparison with the SP decoder.

The source code is currently untidy; a cleaner version will be uploaded later once it's complete.

The source code is inspired by Jincheng Dai et al., *Learning to Decode Protograph LDPC Codes*.
